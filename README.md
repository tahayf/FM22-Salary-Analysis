# FM22-Salary-Analysis

This project analyses the salaries of players in the six biggest football leagues and draws inferences from the data using Python for calculations. The results
show that on average, players in these leagues earn $1.5 million per year.
Additionally, there is a slight correlation between a player's age and their wage, but it cannot be concluded that older players earn more than younger ones.

The dataset was obtained from the website https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ultimus/football-wages-prediction. The data was collected from Football Manager 2022.
